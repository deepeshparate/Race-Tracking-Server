# Race-Tracking-Server
the Tracking Server for simply road-race tracking system that will help race officials, support teams, and spectators monitor where athletes currently are on a race course.

Description:-
Two key types of objects in the system are race events and athletes. A race event has a title and course length.Each athlete has a unique number, called bib number, as well as a first name, last name, gender, and age.

A Simulator is present that can run as a separate program and that will send simulated data to your Tracking Server. The Simulator will read an input file to simulate a real roadrace, but potentially much faster than the actual event would take in real life.Clients (spectators, support personnel, and officials) will subscribe with the server to receive tracking information about specific athletes and will display information about athletes and their status.
